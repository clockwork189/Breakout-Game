Breakout is a game that involves a bunch of bricks on top and a moving paddle on the bottom. 
The goal of the game is to eliminate all bricks to proceed to the next round, with out losing all the balls. 
I worked on this in grade 11 with 2 other class mates. 
It was a grand success then, but looking at what I know now, perhaps a few tweaks should be implemented.
